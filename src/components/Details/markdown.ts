  The theme of our wedding is **Tropical Island Disco**, so think tropical island chic.

  **Fellas**: a nice Hawaiian shirt, linen pants, and huarache sandals. Or, a cream/tan/white linen suit. Absolutely no business casual. Leave the khakis, dress shoes, and blue suits at home. Tropical colors and patterns are encouraged and highly recommended.

  **Ladies**: think summer or cocktail dresses, not anything you would wear to a BBQ. If you choose to wear a beachy dress, consider a tea length or maxi to avoid being too casual. Leave the business casual vibes back at home, tropical colors and patterns are encouraged and highly recommended.

  **For both**: no flip flops, shorts, or what you would wear to the beach. If you need guidance, contact us and we will style you. Styled By Wade.

  We will be saying "I do" in the gorgeous beach town of **Jupiter, FL**. We chose this location because of the many trips we took here while living in Florida a few months this past year and quickly falling in love with its beautiful dark sand beaches and turquoise waters. 

  Our wedding day will be at the **Pelican Club**, a beautiful, lush, romantic venue on the water with breathtaking views of the Jupiter Lighthouse.
