      The theme of our wedding is **Tropical Island Disco**, so think tropical island chic.

      **Fellas**: a nice Hawaiian shirt, linen pants, and huarache sandals. Or, a cream/tan/white linen suit. Absolutely no business casual. Leave the khakis, dress shoes, and blue suits at home. Tropical colors and patterns are encouraged and highly recommended.

      **Ladies**: think summer or cocktail dresses, not anything you would wear to a BBQ. If you choose to wear a beachy dress, consider a tea length or maxi to avoid being too casual. Leave the business casual vibes back at home, tropical colors and patterns are encouraged and highly recommended.

      **For both**: no flip flops, shorts, or what you would wear to the beach. If you need guidance, contact us and we will style you. Styled By Wade.
